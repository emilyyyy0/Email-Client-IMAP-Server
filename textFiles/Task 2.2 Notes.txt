Write email client to connect to IMAP server, and log in using provided credentials. 
And then select a mailbox folder. 

Basic steps to retrieving an email: 
- Create an IPv6 socket (or fall back to IPv4 if IPv6 is not supported) on port 
143 (or a TLS socket on port 993 if doing the extension task and (-t) was 
specified.) to the host named on the command line. 

- Log in to the IMAP server using: 
    tag LOGIN username password 

where username and password are as specified on the command line

Each command is prefixed with an identifier, or tag (such as AO1). 
The tags should all be different within one session. 
These are used for the server to report errors or completion of commands. 

Each line ends with the standard internen end-of-line sequence \r\n (not the C end-of-line).

If this succeeds, you will receive a string starting with the tag, followed by a single space, 
(a case-insensitive) OK, and another single space. 

If it fails,you should print the string Login failure\n to stdout
and exit with status 3.

You may assume that the LOGINDISABLED capability will not be advertised, and do not need to support
RFC5738: IMAP Support for UTF-8.




- Tell the system which folder you want to read from: 
    tag SELECT folder

If this succeeds, you will receive some untagged response lines starting with “*”, 
followed by a string starting with the tag followed by OK .
If the folder doesn’t exist, print the string Folder not found\n to
stdout and exit with status3. 
You should read from the folder INBOX if no folder is specified on the command line.
The next steps depend on which command is being executed.
